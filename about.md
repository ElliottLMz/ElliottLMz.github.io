# About Me

Hello, I'm Eleanor (formerly Elliott). I'm a teenager from North London with an interest in law, psychology, business
and operations, politics, railways, electronics, technology, programming, and video games. I'm currently finishing up my
GCSEs in Sociology, Psychology, Business Studies, and History with a predicted 6, 7, 8, 5, 5, 5, 4, 6.

Most of my technical work is in JavaScript and Luau (Roblox's fork of Lua 5.1); languages that I am proficient in. I am
confident in Web Development, and have worked with [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org)/[Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
regularly.

I have experience working with Ruby, Java, Git, Bash, Python, and MySQL. I have experience building [Discord](https://discord.com) bots,
Roblox games, tooling, web applications and servers (including with Nunjucks and EJS), as well as node modules. I have previously used
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [Heroku](https://heroku.com), [Glitch](https://glitch.com), and [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com).

For 2021, I plan on working heavily with web servers, including learning a variety of tooling and programs, and building a small
digital network for fun. I also plan on expanding my technical portfolio in building and releasing a number of open source projects.

Software wise, I have experience using Adobe Photoshop, paint.net, Adobe Premiere Pro, Roblox Studio, Visual Studio Code,
Eclipse, Postman, draw.io, Microsoft Office, Windows Powershell, and the Windows OS in general.
