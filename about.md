## About Me

Hello, I'm Elliott. I'm a teenager from London with an interest with law, sociology, psychology,
business and economics, politics, railways, electronics, technology, programming, and game design.
I'm currently doing my GCSEs in Sociology, Psychology, Business Studies, and History.

I am currently proficient in JavaScript and Luau (Roblox's fork of Lua).
I consider myself skilled in TypeScript and web development, including CSS
and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) ([Vue](https://vuejs.org)).

I know Ruby, Java, Git, Bash, Python, and MySQL just well enough to pass by
(e.g. this site is built using Jekyll). I have experience building
[Discord](https://discord.com) bots, Roblox games, tooling, web applications and
servers (including the Nunjucks and EJS templating languages), as well as node modules.
I've also used [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), [Heroku](https://heroku.com),
[Glitch](https://glitch.com), and [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com).

I am currently working on improving my experience in managing web servers. I'm working on learning
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), a far better version of NGINX. I'm working on a game
with a few friends called 'Project Titan', and building a number of open-source projects.

Software wise, I have experience using Photoshop and a few other Adobe programs,
paint.net, Roblox Studio, Visual Studio Code.
