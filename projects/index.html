<h1>My Projects</h1>

<p class="mb-3">
  Programming is my passion; I regularly invest in expanding my knowledge and use my technical skills throughout my work.
  Unfortunately a lot of my best work is either incomplete or non-public (but hey, I'm working on it).
  This list demonstrates some of my best or most landmark pieces of work.

  These projects are deprecated, archived, and no-longer maintaned.
  Not all projects will stay in the graveyard forever, but right now these are old projects
  and not necessarily reflective of my current work and standards.
